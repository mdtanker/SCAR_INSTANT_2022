# SCAR INSTNAT 2022
Materials for the [SCAR INSTANT Workshop](https://www.scar.org/scar-news/instant-news/instant-workshop-fort-collins/), 2022.

## Info 
As chairs of SC2.2 “Probing the Solid Earth and Its Interactions” we cordially invite all interested scientists – and especially early-career scientists and students – as well as stakeholders to this work- shop with the goal to discuss the science rationale of geodetic-geophysical in-situ measurements in Antarctica.

We will evaluate the challenges and benefits of utilizing respective infrastructure in dedicated, temporarily restricted projects as well as with a long-term prospect. For this, the international cooperation and coordination will get even more important especially when defining the most important scientific questions and developing new ideas to exploit synergies in a much better way than at present.
